# kha examples

*this example page will not be updated. due to myself now doing the kha-tutorial-series, which is my video tutorial series. which will go through these files. but then go way over them. you can go [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4neAtv21WOmmR5mKb7TQvEQHpMh1h0po) for the video playlist.*

these are some kha examples, to help get new users [plus other users] to get to grips with the super awesome [kha](https://github.com/KTXSoftware/Kha)

its highly recommended to run these projects in the super, uber, duper sexy [kode studio](https://github.com/KTXSoftware/KodeStudio/releases)

follow this super useful post on getting up & running with it - [kode studio forum post](http://kode.tech/kode-studio-16-1/)

also, if you want the super duper awesome theme from the screenshot, grab 'lestle-vscode' from my [lestle theme collection](https://github.com/lewislepton/lestle-theme-collection) & put it in your extension folder.

#LIBRARIES

we will use libraries to harness & do more cool things in kha. why not, were coders ;)
to use libraries inside kha/kode studio. go to your `khafile.js` and put in `project.addLibrary('libraryName');`

• [kha2d](https://github.com/KTXSoftware/Kha2D)<br>
`haxelib install git kha2d https://github.com/KTXSoftware/Kha2D.git`

• [tweenx](http://tweenx.spheresofa.net/en.html)<br>
`haxelib install git tweenx https://github.com/shohei909/tweenx.git`

• [nape](http://napephys.com)<br>
`haxelib install nape`
